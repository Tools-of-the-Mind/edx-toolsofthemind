Thanks @Lawrence McDaniel. We are setting up a session to review the UI with Pat, probably on Thursday. Looking at your current screenshot, the outstanding items (refer: https://co-digitallearning.atlassian.net/ browse/CODLT-332) in priority order are:

1. Show courseware by module (top level) rather than section (2nd level)
2. Show overall grade (is this already there?)
3. Columns are sortable (via click)
4. Show cohort as a column
5. Show email address as column (in addition to full name)
